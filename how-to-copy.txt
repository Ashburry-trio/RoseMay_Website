Below I show you how to copy the RoseMay_Website/* folder
to the home directory where it can be used by the Flask
webserver. It is important you create the filesystem exactly
as-is when created by myself on my PA filesystem.

Unfortunatly when you use the GIT command to copy
the website folder to your Home Directory it puts all
the files in a subdirectory probably named "~/RoseMay_Website/"

I will show you how to copy those files out of that subdirectory
into your home directory as it should be,

Be Carefull this command will overwrite any existing files you may
have already created.

First you need to open a console.
Once it opens and loads, type the following commands:

cd ~/
cp -rf ~/RoseMay_Website/* ~/*

Or just this:

chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

That is all.

After this you need to edit your /var/www/website_com.wsgi file
then edit your "/www/flask_app.py" file and change to:

    config['SERVER_NAME'] = 'username.pythonanywhere.com'

Change the username.pythonanywhere,com with the www.website.com of your webserver.

Under the WEB tab where the STATIC section is add the following two locations:

    /static/    ~/www/website/static/
    /css/       ~/www/website/static/css/
    /img/       ~/www/website/static/images/
This is because sometimes I may use /css/ for the css files instead of url_for('static','css/normal_index.css')
instead I can just put "/css/normal_index.css" or "/static/css/normal_index.css"

Don't forget to:

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
