<p class="h3"><strong>Illicit Drugs</strong> - Tested Every Thursday, at-least one Thursday.</p>
<p class="h6">I am a Licensed Provider, and have been accepted since the age of 3 years-old (trusted) to sell/give Crystal-Meth, Fyntenol, Cannabis, cocain powder, cocain rock, and thats all that I remember.
I have a Masters degree with Grade 10 and a half, and a PhD. from Harvard University. I am retired from the Military where I carried the hat of a Bunnery Instructor (GI) with 10,000 troops at my disposal (all are alive and healthy)</p>
<p>The drug Crystal-Meth, available here, is carefully crafted using only high-grade ingredients and is completely safe; however it has a 2 month withdrawl period with a painful kick in nut (worse?) at the end of your
3rd month (if you over-use this drug, the kick in the nut will happen to you!). So, for the LAST 3 months of running out of supply make sure you use it only on Wednesdays (1/10 gram only which is 0.1g only). I know I said it only has 2 months of withdrawl, however for your 3rd month you feel awesome, until the END of the 3rd month when you will be in URGENT need to use crystal-meth immediately!! If you have to use crystal-meth at all this 4th month IS THE RIGHT TIME. For relaxed and empowering feelings, facing the world forever with a new and improved
brain chemistry: By damaging 3 special parts of brain which <strong>function</strong> only when damaged. If you think you need something to step up your game <strong>quitting this drug</strong> might
be your best and cheapest way to go (and most entertaining). This Cystal-Meth may be SMOKED ONLY. Do NOT inject NOR snort this crystal-meth (smoke only on tinfoil or better yet in a fresh Pyrex bowl pipe [2-5 bowl pipes included]).
