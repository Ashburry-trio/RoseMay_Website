<p>Sorry, the form you filled out is missing the CSRF token. This is probably my fault since my website is still under construction</p>

<p>CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It's a type of cyber attack where a malicious
site tricks a user's browser into performing unwanted actions on a different site where the user
is authenticated. It's like someone forging your signature on a check and then cashing it. </p>
