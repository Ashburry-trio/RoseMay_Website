<p>below this paragraph is a list of proxy-servers you may use with <em>only</em> your <abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr> clients with your secret username and password.
it is recommended to use the <abbr title="mg-script">Machine-Gun</abbr> <abbr title="mIRC scripting language">mSL script</abbr> with either
<a href="https://www.mirc.com/get.html" target="_new">mIRC</a> (costs $20) or
<a href="https://adiirc.com/download.php" target="_new">Adiirc</a> (FREE) <abbr title='IRC'>Internet Relay Chat</abbr> clients.
however, you do not need to use any special script nor IRC client to take advantage of all the features there are to offer by the
proxy-servers alone. this proxy-service is similar to <a href="https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC bounce-service</a>, found on many IRC-networks for free.</p>

<h6>ofc none of these proxy-servers work; that is because there are no IPs or Hostnames to remote destinations. And unless you are running trio-ircproxy.py then none of the proxy-servers will work.</h6>
<h5>Trio-ircproxy.py is not even close to being complete; I am still struggling with this website named RoseMay version PEACE, get it at <a href="https://github.com/ashburry-chat-irc/rosemay">github<a/>..</h5>
