Note: This code is meant to run on https://www.PythonAnywhere.com with the latest Python version and only Flask.
With a small amount of effort you can modify the code to run on a custom install of Flask.
I recommend running the following commands on PythonAnywhere.com Bash shell:

  cd RoseMay_Website \
  chmod +x ./install.sh \
  source ./install.sh

I've had a tough time developing this website; many problems with 'git'. However, I hope this is the latest functional version.
