=============

My website, backed up. web-site code named: RoseMay version Peace-3.0

This website is meant to run on PythonAnywhere.com to network with Internet
Relay Chat oriented proxy-servers. Proxy-servers; add functionality to the
IRC client connection. The web-site will have a register/login using a session
cookie and users folder with .ini files that hold meta-data about the irc
sessions, which are forwarded from the proxy-server to the web-server where
stats can be viewed. Also; from the proxy-servers to the mSL script (Machine-Gun
code named: Bauderr). Custom www.myproxyip.com/user/name/index.html where a XDCC
search engine maybe hosted with search in all server connections. **.search
filename.mkv** can be easily hosted in any IRC rooms of your choosing. It will
search in common channels the user nickname is found in. New xdcc channels can
be added to the index. User only has to mark channel as xdcc-copy and it will be
added to the users user-page search engine. A home page will optionally contain an xdcc search
engine, favourite channels of the user, the channel topics if chanmode is set to
**-s** (**not** secret). Optionally stats may be displayed for everyone to see
such as how many lines of chatter have been spoken by the users, how many users
are average counted in each channel, the current country and local time and date
of the user for the purpose of traffic reports, weather, news, etc. What public
user scripts are turned on/off in the channels either by the user or by any user
of the proxy-server's (both or either-or). Admins of the irc channel, any sponsor
links the irc room and home page has to offer as a means to pay for human
traffic sent to their sponsor page. Ultra-fast dcc accepts. This will cost money
that sponsorship can help afford. From any extra bandwidth purchased for our VPS. 
Our VPS can share Anime files downloaded from the xdcc bot to the vps then from the vps to the requesting
user. There will be no small limit to how many networks one can connect to, or
banning of legitimate IRC networks such as DALnet and UnderNet. No hacked
servers, but much faster legit servers with paid-for: storage, transfer, RAM,
CPU individually. It will be expensive but we are going to need it. Two web-sites cost \$12 a
month on recommended plan. If we put \$17 in to two web-sites we can get a-lot
more CPU-time (fast up-time) and have myProxyIP.com and www.myProxyIP.com even a third and forth
website for xdcc.myProxyIP.com and users.myProxyIP.com. With cloud-VPS hosting service, some vCPUs, 
sufficient RAM, and massive storage for every Anime show, decent network
speeds, tons of bandwidth (bytes sent & recv'd). And lots of sponsorship with
intelligent decision making that makes maximum sales for our sponsors. Giving
away Pot and edibles, E-Vapes, real, safe, from Canada,
crystal-meth (tested every Sunday); where my friends can spend their money,
receive entertainment and real income and wealth. With lots of great SAFE prizes to
be bought for you to choose from, the simple yet effective casino may make enough money to host 8 vCPUs,
that’s \$50 USD/month. I will need some help to pay for this. I am willing to
pay \$50 CAD/month for 4 vCPUs which should host at-least 600 connections (best guess). 
Plus I need at-least one connection to  www.myProxyIP.com. For $x? USD dollars a month I can put your proxy-servers, and your friends,
on an exclusive vCPU where there is zero traffic, you may also choose a few months worth of private proxy server
as a money-spent prize in the casino.

Have a nice day, I've got to continue my coding.
