# mslscript.com
My website, backed up. web-site named: RoseMay

This website is meant to run on PythonAnywhere.com to network with Internet Relay Chat oriented proxy-servers.
Proxy-servers; which add functionality to the IRC client connection. The web-site will have a register/login using session cookie
and users folder with .ini files that hold meta-data about the irc sessions, which are forwarded from the proxy-server
to the web-server where stats can be viewed. Custom www.mslscript.com/username/index.html where a XDCC search engine maybe hosted
with search in all xdcc bots. and **.search filename.mkv** can be easily hosted in any IRC rooms of their choosing. It will search in 
common channels the user nickname is found in. New xdcc channels can be added to the index after admin verifies the files are safe and legit through
md5 and sha256 hash-codes. User only has to mark channel as xdcc-copy and it will be added to the users homepage. A home page will optionally contain
an xdcc search engine, favourite channels of the user, the channel topics if chanmode set to **-s** (**not** secret). Optionally stats may be displayed
for everyone to see such as how many lines of chatter have been spoken by the user, how many users are average in each channel, the current country and local time
and date of the user for the purpose of traffic reports and weather. What public user scripts are in turned on in the channel either by the user or by any user of
the proxy-servers (both or either-or). Admins of the irc channel, any sponsor links the irc room and home page has to offer as a means to pay
for human traffic sent to their sponsor page. Ultra-fast dcc accepts not sends. 100MB in 4secs to the VPS then to the user either as is 
(or streamed, maybe one day). Unpack on VPS shell, scan for virii, post similar to a youtube video on their web-site for other people to watch. 
This will cost money that sponsorship can help affored. https://pot420.shop/ is already a willing sponsor, if we can all sell some ounces of pot and edibles we can all benefit from
any extra bandwidth our VPS can spread across one file download from the xdcc bot the vps then from the vps to other users avoiding the xdcc bot all-together from that point on.
All downloads are shared with all proxy-server/httpsd/shell registered login holders. There will be no small limit to how many networks one can connect to, or banning
of legitemit IRC networks such as DALnet and UnderNet. I plan on streaming all Anime I can stuff on to a cloud-VPS and bare-metal servers. With legit sponsorship,
that everyone can benefit from. Not just those that spam the hardest. No hacked servers, but much faster legit servers with paid-for: storage, transfer, RAM, CPU.
It will be expensive but we are going to need it. 3 web-sites cost $99 a month on recommended plan. If we put $50 in to one web-site we can get alot more CPU-time
and up-time. The web-site can go from Flask to something more quick, however its not like these are huge pages of processing. And processing can be done on cheaper
metal and bare hyper-text sent to Flask. Maybe hosting a large user-base on Flask is just a dream but I think I can figure a way to do it. With cloud-VPS/bare-metal
hosting services with large DDOS mitigation, minimal CPU, maximum RAM, and storage, fast network speeds, tons of bandwidth (bytes sent & recv'd). And lots of
sponsorship with intelligent descision making that makes maximum sales for our sponsors. Such as what I did for packetnews.com back in the day when it was fake
xdcc search engine, with the intent of making xdcc searches seam virus filled, unable to find with a web-browser, lousy selection of downloads. I hacked it,
set up legit xdcc search, put some hacked Playstation one and two sponsorship to go with a shitload of Playstation games to download and burn. And turned it 
all over to that asshole to maintain and he got rich and let it go down the drain. But hey, atleast we had Playstation chips and games. I can do it again, 
this time selling online game passes and casinos where my friends can spend their money with legit casinos that share the wealth and provide entertainment and 
real income and wealth. Selling bandwidth with instant download speeds to sponsorship programs. It can and will be done but first things first I must finish this document.
